# Predictive_analysis_for_scrabble
Based on the scrabble competition on Kaggle

This project aimed to build a predictive model to predict a Scrabble playerâ€™s rating before playing the
game. Scrabble is a two-person crossword board game where players place letter tiles on the
board to create words. Players earn points based on several factors, such as the board's location
and the word's length.

The project used gameplay data from Woogles.io, an online version of Scrabble, to train and test to build
the best-performing model. The model performance was evaluated using root mean squared error
(RMSE), which captures the average difference between predicted and ground truth ratings.

As the result, this project reached an RMSE = 110, which can be within top 100 leaderboard on Kaggle.
